## Abstract 

Persistent ecosystem state changes can result when multiple drivers that affect an ecosystem's function interact. For example, exotic plant invasions can alter ecosystem structure, and altered structure can change the likelihood of a disturbance, the properties of a disturbance and the capacity of the system to recover after a disturbance. Altered disturbance regimes can ultimately lead to changes in species composition and losses of biodiversity. In the sagebrush ecosystems in the western United States, widespread annual grass invasion has increased fuel connectivity, which increases the size and spatial contiguity of fires, leading to post-fire monocultures of introduced annual grasses (IAG). The novel grassland state is persistent, and more likely to promote large fires than the shrubland it replaced. But the mechanisms by which pre-fire invasion and fire occurrence are linked to higher post-fire flammability are not fully understood. 

Here, we hypothesized that fuel connectivity would increase burn severity, which would then have affect seed bank survivorship to favor IAG, leading to increased post-fire fuel connectivity. We found that pre-fire fuel connectivity increased burn severity. We then used a Bayesian joint species distribution model to examine how burn severity affected the proportion of IAG in the seed bank, and found that higher burn severity had mostly positive effects on the occurrence of IAG and another non-native species, and mostly negative or neutral relationships with all other species. Finally, we found that the abundance of IAG seeds in the seedbank immediately post-fire had a positive effect on the fuel connectivity 3 years after fire, completing a positive feedback promoting IAG. These results demonstrate that the strength of the positive feedback is controlled by measurable characteristics of ecosystem structure, composition and disturbance, and each node in the loop is affected independently by multiple global change drivers. It is possible that these characteristics can be modeled to predict threshold behavior and inform management actions to mitigate the undesirable effects of the grass-fire cycle, perhaps via targeted restoration applications or pre-fire fuel treatments.

<!-- ##### overview - Alternative stable states -->

Ecosystems around the world are being affected simultaneously by multiple facets of global change. For example, changes in land use can facilitate exotic plant invasions [@Allan2015], which can alter ecosystem structure [@Davies2013]. Altered structure can change the likelihood of a disturbance, the properties of a disturbance and the capacity of the system to recover after a disturbance. Global climate change can also affect the magnitude of disturbances [@Parks2020], and as well as the ability of ecosystems to recover after disturbance [@Rother2015; @Davis2019]. The combined effects of global change forces on structure, function and disturbance can cascade and interact. For example, while burn severity is primarily controlled by vegetation structure [@Koontz2020], it also increases with temperature and aridity [@Parks2020]. These forces can ultimately lead to permanent compositional change, biodiversity losses and the loss of ecosystem services [@Ratajczak2018; @Mahood2019; @Mahood2021] due to internal, self-reinforcing mechanisms that arise from those structural and functional changes which then maintain an alternative stable state [@Scheffer2003; @Ratajczak2018]. 

There is a long history of univariate time series observations that show sudden state changes [@Scheffer2003], and these have informed the development of theories that help us understand how systems of any type can change state suddenly, and exist in persistent alternative stable states [@Scheffer2015;  @Ratajczak2018]. <!--no mechanisms here--> These theories typically focus on a single driver affecting a single variable that represents the system's state [@Scheffer2015]. Correlative evidence of alternative stable states has been documented at broad scales in tropical ecosystems, where forests, savannas and grasslands are considered alternative stable states because they are floristically distinct [@Aleman2020] and cluster around static values of woody cover (80, 30 and 0 percent) while occurring along overlapping ranges of precipitation [@Hirota2011; @Staver2011]. In the forested state there is thought to be a self-reinforcing, positive feedback between evapotranspiration and tree cover [@Staal2020], while the grassland and savanna states are thought to be maintained by feedbacks between grass flammability and fire occurrence [@DAntonio1992; @Staver2011]. Alternative stable states are believed to be widespread [@Scheffer2001], but  outside of greenhouse and laboratory microcosm experiments [@Schroder2005], are difficult to experimentally demonstrate at broader scales. One of the reasons for this is that ecological systems are much more complex than a simple bivariate system with a single driver and a single response. There may be multiple drivers, and the state is the product of interactions between organisms and their immediate environment, as well as countless inter- and intraspecific interactions.

<!-- ##### zoom in on cheatgrass -->

A classic example of an alternative stable state <!-- of altered vegetation structure leading to a novel ecosystem state that is persistent --> is the invasion of *Bromus tectorum* L. and other introduced annual grasses in the Great Basin of the western United States. Here, the interaction of exotic plant invasions, fire [@Balch2013] and grazing [@Williamson2019] has resulted in the degradation or loss of over half of Wyoming big sagebrush (*Artemisia tridentata* ssp. *wyomingensis* Beetle & Young) ecosystems [@Davies2011]. In these systems, the space between shrubs is typically composed of bare ground covered in biological soil crust and dotted with perennial plants. The lack of fuel connectivity  limits fire spread, with a pre-colonial fire regime of infrequent, patchy fires [@Baker2006; @Bukowski2013]. Annual grass invasion increases fuel connectivity while decreasing fuel moisture [@Davies2013], leading to increased fire size and frequency [@Knapp1996; @Balch2013]. After fire, the landscape is typically dominated by introduced annual grasses. <!-- The post-fire, annual-dominated state may persist without subsequent fire by reductions in soil moisture to the detriment of *Artemisia* seedlings [@Turnbull2012; @Wilcox2012], and competition from non-native annuals for early spring moisture [@Meyer1994; @Chambers2007]. --> **But in order to understand how fire drives the persistence of the grassland state, the mechanisms by which fire benefits the introduced annual grass must be understood.**

<!-- ##### seeds as a demographic bottleneck (add in more seed-specific stuff here) -->

@Petraitis1999 posited that the maintenance of alternate species assemblages requires first a disturbance that removes the species from the initial assemblage and second the arrival of the species of the alternate assemblage. One understudied mechanism that may explain both is the interaction between the species composition of the soil seed bank and burn severity. Because the invading species are annual, and most of the native plants are seed obligates, the seed is the key life history stage that fire must act upon to benefit the invading plants. Seeds and seedlings are particularly vulnerable to climate, competition and disturbance [@Enright2015]. Warmer and drier conditions simultaneously reduce recruitment, growth, and survival of seeds and seedlings [@Enright2015; @Schlaepfer2014], while also increasing burn severity [@Parks2020]. In fire prone ecosystems, seed obligate species typically have strategies to cope with fires that burn at different severities [@Maia2012; @Wright2016; @Palmer2018]. Soil heating from fire affects the response of vegetation to fire [@Gagnon2015], including the capacity of seeds to remain viable after fire [@Humphrey2001]. High severity fire can affect species that use the seedbank positively [@Kimura2011], negatively [@Heydari2017], or have no effect [@Lipoma2018], depending on species-specific adaptations. Both the depth of the burn and fire temperature can affect subsequent recovery by seed germination [@Morgan1988; @Schimmel1996], as well as seed mortality and physical seed dormancy mechanisms [@Liyanage2017]. 
<!-- ##### burn severity increased by cheatgrass -->

In addition to size and frequency, exotic plant invasions can alter fire temperature [@Brooks2004; @Jones2015] and burn severity (or the proportion of biomass burned [@Keeley2009]). While in many cases fires that burn at higher temperatures will also consume more biomass, grass fires may not always have such a relationship. Direct measurements have shown that *B. tectorum* burns at low temperatures [@Beckstead2011; @Germino2016], but because it also increases horizontal fuel connectivity [@Davies2013], it leads to more contiguously burned areas and therefore higher burn severity, despite lower fire temperatures. In order for an annual like *B. tectorum* it to benefit from fire, which it clearly does [@Balch2013; @Mahood2019], it would need enough viable seeds in the post-fire landscape to achieve a fitness benefit and become well-represented in the post-fire plant assemblage [@Bond1995]. If the fire is patchy, this can happen through post-fire seed dispersal, and *B. tectorum* seeds have been shown to have increased dispersal distances after fire [@Monty2013]. Without unburned patches, seeds must survive the fire. <!-- *Bromus tectorum* typically builds a well-stocked pool of seeds in the soil and litter, even when it is not well represented in the above-ground plant assemblage [@Young1975; @Hassan1986; @Boudell2002]. --> If the increase in fuel connectivity caused by *B. tectorum* increases the severity of fire, it stands to reason that burn severity would then influence the community composition of the post-fire seed bank in a way that facilitates the post-fire dominance of *B. tectorum*. In other words, an area with high burn severity should have a lower occurrence of viable seeds of native species, and a higher occurrence of the seeds of fire-tolerant introduced annual plants. This would lead to the dominance of introduced annual grasses and would result in higher fuel connectivity, closing the positive feedback loop. Plants that are not adapted to frequent fire would be less likely to produce seeds that are adapted to surviving fire, or dispersal mechanisms to take advantage of the resources available immediately after fire [@Keeley2011]. To our knowledge, despite several studies on the relationship between fire occurrence and the seed bank in this system [@Young1975; @Hassan1986; @Humphrey2001; @Boudell2002; @Barga2018], no studies to date have examined this potential effect of burn severity on the seed bank in this system.

<!-- Furthermore, *A. tridentata* relies on tolerating drought and opportunistically devoting its resources to producing large seed crops in cool, wet years [@Meyer1994; @Perryman2001; @Shriver2018]. -->

<!-- Increases in temperature and aridity in the Great Basin [@Melillo2014; @Bradford2020] will affect *A. tridentata* directly by decreasing germination and seedling survival, and indirectly by causing the plants to produce lighter seeds [@Schlaepfer2014], and result in fewer years that are climatically suitable for establishment.   -->
<!--When it burns it burns with high intensity, killing individual plants, and the remaining unburned neighbors seed the area [*sensu* @Schwilk2002]. The seeds have a short dispersal distance, the vast majority falling within a few meters of the parent plant [@Meyer1994; @Schlaepfer2014]. They typically lose their viability after one growing season if they remain on the soil surface or under litter, but can remain viable for at least two years if they are buried under a few inches of soil [@Wijayratne2009]. -->

<!-- ##### climate change -->
<!-- With this in mind, there is another potential self-reinforcing mechanism that could serve to maintain the high fuel connectivity state without fire. That is that the post-fire state with high fuel connectivity is associated with two mechanisms for competitive exclusion of natives. First, it reduces soil moisture which is unfavorable for *Artemisia* seedlings [@Turnbull2012; @Wilcox2012]. Second, the dominant plant, *B. tectorum*, can out-compete native plants for early spring moisture [@Meyer1994; @Chambers2007]. -->

<!-- ##### what we did -->

Here, we collected soil cores from 14 locations along the perimeter of a large fire (the Hot Pot fire, ~50,000 ha) immediately after it was extinguished, in northern Nevada in July 2016. Because it burned a large area in only three days, we could sample a broad area while being reasonably certain that the climatic conditions during the fire were the same at all sites. Because we collected our samples immediately after the fire was extinguished, we felt confident that the seed bank samples did not contain seeds deposited by post-fire dispersal. We put the samples in cold storage and germinated the seeds from those cores in a greenhouse the following spring. In spring 2017 and fall 2019 we collected information on vegetation structure and diversity at each location. We hypothesized that (H1) Pre-fire fuel connectivity would be positively related to burn severity; (H2) burn severity would increase the occurrence probability of introduced annual species in the seed bank and reduce the occurrence probability of native species; (H2a) increased fuel connectivity brought on by the invasion of annual grasses already depleted the diversity of the soil seed bank before the fire occurred; (H3) the abundance of post-fire *B. tectorum* seeds would be positively related to post-fire fuel connectivity. In addition, because in our study system post-fire sites are often near monocultures of *B. tectorum*, we hypothesized that (H4) high post-fire fuel connectivity of those near-monocultures would result in lower aboveground species diversity due to competitive pressure.

## 2. Methods


*2.1 Study Area*

The study was conducted in north-central Nevada the day after a large fire (the Hot Pot Fire) was extinguished (Appendix S1, Fig. S1). The Hot Pot Fire burned just over 50,000 hectares in less than a week. The pre-fire landcover was predominantly *B. tectorum* and Wyoming big sagebrush plant communities. The fire occurred after the early season plants, including *B. tectorum* and *Poa secunda* J. Presl, the most abundant native understory species, had gone to seed, and before the late season species, including Wyoming big sagebrush, had produced flowers. Thus we were able to isolate the effect of the fire without any confounding effects of post-fire seed dispersal, while achieving a broad spatial extent. The sites we sampled ranged from 1,397 to 1,607 meters in elevation. 

*2.2 Seed Bank Sampling* 

In early July 2016, we collected samples of the soil seed bank at fourteen locations the day after the Hot Pot fire was contained. Each site was located at the perimeter of the fire where it was clearly delineated by a bulldozer line or in one case a narrow dirt road. Eleven sites were mature sagebrush communities with no history of fire since at least 1984. Three plots had previously burned in 1984 according to the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) fire history [@Eidenshink2007] and had high cover of *B. tectorum*, but still had scattered sagebrush cover. We used a metal stake to mark paired burned and unburned sampling locations on each side of the perimeter, 10 m from the nearest evidence of anthropogenic disturbance (i.e. bulldozer effects, footprints) associated with active fire suppression along the perimeter. Within 3 m of each marker, we extracted 12, 6 cm deep, 5 cm diameter, soil cores. Seeds of sagebrush generally do not fall far (<30 m) from their parent plants in this system [@Shinneman2016], and so they are not uniformly distributed [@Boudell2002]. In addition, seeds from *B. tectorum* [@Young1975] and *Artemisia* have different germination rates based on the micro-site they find themselves in [i.e. under a shrub or in the bare ground between shrubs, @Eckert1986]. To account for these potentially confounding effects, we placed half of the core locations under shrubs, and half in shrub interspaces. In the burned areas, it was obvious where shrubs had been located. Even when they were completely incinerated, their imprint remained on the soil surface [@Bechtold2007; @Germino2018]. To examine the effect of seed depth, we divided each soil core into 0-2 cm and 2-6 cm depths. Litter was aggregated with the 0-2 cm samples. Samples were then placed in cold storage (~2 deg C) for 3 months [@Meyer2013]. At all sites, to be sure that we were at a site where sagebrush germination could occur we checked for first year germinants on the unburned side (we found them at all sites), and to ensure that there were no confounding effects of post-fire seed dispersal, we determined whether or not the sagebrush were flowering (they were not flowering at all sites), and recorded species occupancy for all aboveground plant species. 

We followed the methodology of Ter Heert et al. [-@Heerdt1996] to germinate the seeds. Each sample was run through 0.2 mm sieve, and spread in a 3-5 mm layer over the top of 1 - 4 pots. These pots were filled 3 cm deep with potting soil, topped by a thin layer of sand. Pots were watered as needed to stay at field capacity. Every week emerging germinants were identified, counted and removed. Most of the germination occurred within 6 weeks, and after 8 weeks we ended the germination assay.  


*2.3 Post-Fire Vegetation Sampling*

We sampled the vegetative occupancy and cover in May 2017, the growing season immediately after the fire and again in September 2019. At each location, we established 50m transects starting at the boundary of the burned and unburned sides of the perimeter, running perpendicular to the fire perimeter, and marked the transect ends with rebar. We measured the occupancy and abundance of all plant species by measuring cover of every species in 0.1 m$^2$ quadrats spaced every 5 m along each transect. We used the line intercept method to measure shrub cover and herbaceous plant cover along the transect. Both live and dead plants were included in these measurements. Total vegetation cover (TVC) was defined as the sum of herbaceous plant cover and shrub cover. 

*2.4 Estimating Burn Severity with Landsat 8 OLI*

We downloaded the "fire bundle" of the Hot Pot fire from www.mtbs.gov. This included cloud-free Landsat 8 scenes collected before the Hot Pot fire, and already calculated layers of the Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio [dNBR, @Miller2009]. Because our sites were generally within 10 meters of the burn perimeter, The pixels directly intersecting the plot locations were likely to be mixed pixels (i.e. containing burned and unburned ground). To minimize this effect, we extracted all the dNBR values within a 120 meter buffer of each seed bank plot for pixels whose centroids fell inside of the fire perimeter and calculated the mean. 

*2.5 Statistical Analysis*

Our statistical analysis centered around trying to understand each component of the positive feedback loop posited by the 4 hypotheses described above. In order to understand how pre-fire fuel connectivity influenced burn severity (H1), we used total vegetation cover (TVC) from two separate data sources as a proxy for fuel connectivity, and created separate linear models with TVC as the predictor variable and burn severity [dNBR, @Miller2009] as the response variable. With the field data we collected, we created an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear model with burn severity as the dependent variable and TVC (defined as shrub cover plus herbaceous plant cover from the unburned side of the paired plots), elevation and aspect as independent variables. 

We were concerned that because our data were collected at the edge of the fire, the burn severity calculated at each point may have included partially burned pixels. So, as a supplement, we examined the same relationship by creating a model of TVC using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) surface reflectance data using TVC from the Bureau of Land Management's Assessment, Inventory and Monitoring dataset [AIM, @AIM]. The AIM dataset contained 813 sampling locations within the Central Basin and Range ecoregion [@CEC2006] that were visited by BLM field crews between 2011 and 2015. They were mostly sampled once but there were some repeats, for 1,117 total measurements. For each of these points, we extracted the surface reflectance values of each Landsat band for the sampling year near peak biomass using a cloud-free scene from May or early June. Then, we used those surface reflectance values to calculate various vegetation indexes (Appendix S1: Table S1), including the Green Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (Green NDVI, Equation 1), and Normalized Differenced Senesced Vegetation Index (NDSVI, Equation 2). We used these indexes to create generalized linear model of TVC with a beta distribution. For this and all linear models, we started with the largest possible model and used backwards selection following the methodology of @Zuur2009. We used the final reduced model to create a layer of predicted TVC for the study area for the pre-fire scene, and extracted both our predictions of TVC and dNBR of the fire from 1000 regularly-spaced points within the fire perimeter. Finally, to quantify the effect of TVC on burn severity, we created an OLS linear model with our modeled TVC and its second-order polynomial as predictor variables and burn severity as the response variable.

**Equation 1:** $Green~NDVI = \frac{NIR - Green}{NIR + Green}$

**Equation 2:** $NDSVI = \frac{SWIR_1 - Red}{SWIR_1 + Red}$

To examine how burn severity affected the community composition of the seed bank (H2), we created a joint species distribution model (JSDM) in a Bayesian framework [@HMSC] for the occurrence of all species germinated from the seed bank that were found at more than one location. We created four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains, each consisting of 150,000 iterations. We discarded the first 50,000 iterations for each chain and then recorded every 100th for a total of 1,000 posterior samples per chain, and 4,000 total. We assessed model convergence using the effective sample size and the potential scale reduction factor [@Gelman1992]. We used the model to predict the probability of occurrence of germinable seeds of a given species along a gradient of burn severity. We included burn severity, elevation, aspect, pre-fire seedbank diversity and soil depth as independent variables. 

To account for the possibility of H2a as a confounding factor, we included the Shannon-Weaver diversity index [@Shannon1949] in the paired, unburned seed bank samples as one of the predictor variables in our JSDM. We also created OLS models with the unburned species richness and Shannon-Weaver diversity index predicted by prefire fuel connectivity, with the expectation that pre-fire fuel connectivity would have had a negative effect on the prefire seedbank diversity. To examine how community composition and burn severity then affected subsequent fuel connectivity (H3), we created OLS models with fuel connectivity three years post-fire as the dependent variable, and burn severity, seed counts for *B. tectorum*, *P. secunda* and other species, elevation, aspect, depth, and alpha diversity as independent variables. To examine how the resulting fuel connectivity was related to biodiversity (H4), we used the diversity data and connectivity data that we collected in 2019 to create a Poisson GLM with number of species encountered aboveground at each plot location as the dependent variable, as well as an OLS linear model with the Shannon-Weaver index [@Shannon1949] as a dependent variable. We used fuel connectivity, elevation, and aspect as independent variables.

All analyses were done in R [@R]. Data and code to recreate the analysis are freely available at https://www.github.com/admahood/seed-bank (DOI available after acceptance) and the Dryad data repository (url given after acceptance). 

## 3. Results
 
We found support for each hypothesized component of the positive feedback loop. For H1, the most parsimonious model for our *in situ* observations had only TVC as the predictor, which had a weak positive relationship with burn severity ($\beta$ = 2.4, p = 0.083, R$^2$ = 0.27, Figure 1a, Appendix 1: Table S2). For our remotely sensed analysis, our most parsimonious model of TVC explained 35% of the variation and had Green NDVI, NDSVI and their interaction as predictors (Appendix S1: Table S2). Our model of dNBR using the predicted TVC within the fire perimeter as a predictor of dNBR explained 42% of the variation and the relationship between TVC and burn severity was positive and significant (p << 0.01, Figure 1a, Appendix S1: Table S2). 


The vast majority of seeds that germinated in the greenhouse were the two most common grass species, *P secunda* and *B. tectorum* (Appendix S1: Table S3). Eight forb species were found in more than one location, and these 10 prevalent species are those that were used in our JSDM. Burned plots had an average of 34 $\pm$ 32 total seeds in the top 2 cm, and 12 $\pm$ 14 in the bottom 4 cm. Unburned plots had an average of 299 $\pm$ 170 in the top 2 cm and 59 $\pm$ 29 in the bottom 4 cm (Appendix S1: Fig. S2). For H2, the JSDM converged well (Appendix S1: Fig S3). Gelman diagnostics all very close to 1 and the effective sample size centered on 4,000. Elevation had the most significant effects on individual species and explained the most variance on average (36%). Burn severity explained 23% of the variance on average and was supported at the 95% level for 5 species. For the introduced species, the predictions along a gradient of burn severity were positive for *B. tectorum*, *Sisymbrium altissimum* L. and *Lepidium perfoliatum* L., and negative for *Ceratocephala testiculata* and *Alyssum desertorum* Stapf. For native species, the effect of burn severity on occurrence was positive for *A. tridentata*, neutral for *P. secunda* and negative for the remaining species. Testing H2a revealed a positive relationship between pre-fire aboveground species diversity and pre-fire fuel connectivity, and so we felt it was reasonable to rule out pre-fire fuel connectivity as a confounding factor for H2.

For H3, we found that, after accounting for elevation, pre-fire aboveground richness, and the number of *P. secunda* seeds, the number of *B. tectorum* seeds in the postfire seedbank was positively associated with the fuel connectivity in 2019 ($\beta$ = 0.54, p = 0.01, Adj R$^2$ = 0.75,Figure 1c, Appendix S1: Table S2). For H4 the most parsimonious model (Adj R$^2$ = 0.89, Appendix S1: Table S2) had elevation, aspect, fuel connectivity and an interaction between elevation and fuel connectivity as predictors of aboveground Shannon-Weaver alpha diversity. Fuel connectivity was negatively associated with Shannon-Weaver diversity ($\beta$ = -0.28, p=0.004, Figure 1d).


## 4. Discussion

<!-- Theory + GCC -->
<!-- hotter and drier climate increases flammability, leading to severity increases, droungt increases seed mortality  -->

<!-- focus on multiple drivers here -->

<!-- post-fire state is not just a change in woody plant cover, it's a completely different ecosystem with a different flora (aleman2020) and different function (H4), and so just dialing back the climate, for example wouldn't really work because the biotic material is no longer present -->

<!-- the difference between here and tropical systems is that since the late 1800s there's a novel land use change (livestock grazing vs ungulate browsing), a novel species introduction (cg et al) cite Mack 1981 and similar old papers, and a novel change in climate -->

Here we document the mechanisms by which changes in ecosystem structure brought on by invasion can lead to cascading effects on ecosystem function and composition via changes in the disturbance regime. It has already been shown that *B. tectorum* invasion increases fire frequency [@Balch2013], and from this we can infer the existence of a grass-fire cycle. However, in order to truly consider an annual grass-fire cycle to be maintained by self-reinforcing feedbacks, the mechanisms by which fire occurrence is linked to higher post-fire flammability must be understood. The interaction between burn severity and seed bank composition documented here may explain that link. Prior work has shown that annual grass invasion increases fuel connectivity by filling in shrub interspaces with a contiguous bed of fine fuels [@Davies2013]. This change in the spatial distribution of fine fuels has been associated with larger and more frequent fires [@Balch2013]. Here, we found higher fuel connectivity (via TVC) increased burn severity (H1, Figure 1a). Higher burn severity was associated with an increased occurrence of introduced annuals in the seedbank and a decreased occurrence of native plants (H2, Figure 1b). Finally, greater abundance of *B. tectorum* seeds in the post-fire seedbank resulted in higher post-fire fuel connectivity (H3, Figure 1c). In addition, we found evidence that high post-fire fuel connectivity was associated with lower aboveground diversity (H4, Figure 1d). This suggests that during inter-fire intervals, there may be additional mechanisms (e.g. competition, altered ecohydrology) maintaining the post-fire, annual grass-dominated species assemblage.

The difference in species composition before and after fire explains an apparent contradiction in results between H2a (positive relationship between pre-fire fuel connectivity and diversity) and H4 (negative relationship between post-fire fuel connectivity and diversity). Most plot locations had mature canopies of native shrubs with the inter-shrub space occupied mostly by native bunchgrasses and forbs, with no fire occurrence since 1984. Even in locations with high annual grass cover between shrubs, shrubs provide ecosystem structural heterogeneity and islands of fertility [@Doescher1984; @Bechtold2007], and perennial natives that may have been established before invasion have deep roots established that allow for the avoidance of competition for water with shallow-rooted annuals [@Gibbens2001; @Ottaviani2020]. This may provide enough niche compartmentalization to allow native plants to persist in spite of the invasion. Three years after fire, almost all of the plots were dominated by introduced annuals, and lacked any structural heterogeneity. Thus native plants may have been be able to persist via niche compartmentalization after the initial invasion, but fire burned away most of the seeds (Appendix S1, Fig. S1) and removed all of the structural benefits, and microclimatic refugia that shrub cover provides. In this clean slate post-fire environment, the altered species composition of the seedbank and superior post-fire dispersal of *B. tectorum* [@Monty2013] allow the process of interspecific competition to be dominant [@Schlaepfer2014].

***Global implications***

Understanding how different facets of global change create multiple mechanisms that act in concert to drive ecosystem transformation will provide important insights about ecosystem change on a global scale.Eecological systems are much more complex than a simple bivariate system with a single driver and a single response. The system studied here has at least three external processes that influence the positive feedback loop we documented. First, land use change in the form of the introduction of livestock grazing facilitates invasion [@Ponzetti2007; @Williamson2019]. The introduction of exotic grasses increases fuel connectivity [@Davies2013], which we document affects burn severity, and finally increasing temperatures due to climate change both increase burn severity [@Parks2020] while simultaneously decreasing seed viability and seedling survival [@Schlaepfer2014; @Enright2015]. Finally, CO$_2$ enrichment may preferentially enhance biomass (i.e. higher fuel connectivity) and seed production of annual grass species [@Smith2000; @Nagel2004], strengthening the fuel connectivity to burn severity to seed composition feedback loop. All four of these external drivers are globally ubiquitous consequences of global change.

The "state" the ecosystem is the product of countless endogenous interactions. The grass-fire cycle studied here is reinforced through providing fitness benefits to the introduced annual grasses via at least three redundant processes: i) changing the composition of the seedbank, ii) competitive exclusion of native plants,  iii) ecohydrological feedbacks that create a warmer, drier microclimate [@Turnbull2012; @Wilcox2012]. It is likely that some of these feedbacks are idiosyncratic to the system being studied, while others may reflect fundamental properties of ecosystem function that change when a system is converted from being dominated by woody plants to being dominated by herbaceous plants [@Kitzberger2016]. At least 13 grass species initiate self-reinforcing feedbacks with fire in the U.S. alone [@Fusco2019; @Tortorelli2020]. There are likely many more worldwide, beyond documented cases in Australia [@Miller2010; @Setterfield2010], Brazil [@Rossi2014] and South Africa [@Milton2004]. The conversion of temperate forests and shrublands to grasslands has consequences relevant to the global carbon cycle, especially when forests (rather than the shrublands studied here) are replaced by herbaceous ecosystems [@Kerns2020]. 

Interestingly enough, thinking back to classic conceptual models like the saddle-node bifurcation curve, or the ball and cup visualization [@Scheffer2015], the multivariate nature of both the driver and response leads us to expand both the driver and the response axes to n-dimensional space, and perhaps a more accurate conceptual visualization of ecosystems transformation due to multiple global change drivers more closely resembles the loss landscapes generated by artificial neural networks [@Li2018]. 

***Potential limitations***

We found fewer species and lower diversity in our seedbank germination assays than we did in the aboveground sampling (Appendix S1, Fig. S3). This result may be influenced by the methodological limitations inherent to greenhouse germination trials [@Vandvik2016]. In particular our results may be understating the occurrence of native species that are habitat specialists. Habitat specialists have been shown to emerge more in *in situ* germination assays than in greenhouse germination assays, while the opposite has been found for ruderal species [@Plue2017]. Nevertheless, for those species that were prevalent in our germination studies, we still found consistent relationships between their abundance and occurrence by biogeographic origin, and those species that were most prevalent in the seedbank germination assays were also representative of those that we observed in the aboveground community.

***Contrasts among forests and shrublands as it pertains to remote sensing***

Burn severity metrics like dNBR were conceived of in the context of forested ecosystems, and calibrated using the composite burn index [@Key1999], tree mortality, and percent change in tree canopy cover [@Miller2009]. It is unclear how well these metrics carry over to shrubland systems. We recorded qualitative observations of burn severity while we were sampling, mainly to ensure that we sampled a range of severities, and the dNBR we used appears to correspond with our observations. In areas where the space between shrubs was well-connected by fine fuels (Figure 2 a-c) the dNBR was higher, and the shrubs had completely burned throughout the root system, leaving only a hole in the ground filled with ashes as evidence of their prior presence. In these areas the entirety of the soil surface---underneath shrub canopy and in canopy interspaces---was consumed by fire, and there was little evidence of remaining litter or biological soil crust. Areas with lower fuel connectivity had lower dNBR (Figure 2 d-f). Here, shrubs were usually consumed only to the stumps, and sometimes left standing and charred, destined for mortality. In these areas the soil surface often still had biological soil crust, partially consumed litter [@Jones2015] and unconsumed annual and perennial grass bases. The manual severity classification provided by MTBS had exclusively low and medium severity, but our observations of essentially complete consumption of plant and litter tissues and very few unburned patches suggested that these should have been mostly medium and high severity. This discrepancy was not unexpected, as the ordinal burn severity classifications produced by MTBS are known to be of limited use for research [@Kolden2015].

Spectral reflectance has long been used to characterize ecosystem structure, including wildfire fuels. Unique signatures of remotely-sensed spectral reflectance are typically matched to categorical fuel classifications (CFCs), which describe the physiognomy of vegetation and its potential to support various fire behavior [@Ottmar2007]. While different CFCs can provide a general understanding of fuel amount and connectivity, recent efforts using data with finer spatial and spectral resolution may improve fuel classification with more continuous, multi-dimensional measurements [@Stavros2018]. The continuous measure of NDVI in western U.S. coniferous forests is a proxy for live fuel biomass, which likely explains its positive association with wildfire severity [@Parks2018; @Koontz2020]. NDVI also correlates with vegetation cover in these forested systems, and so greater crown connectivity may also explain the NDVI/severity relationship at local scales. When using a more direct NDVI-derived measure of vegetation connectivity in Sierra Nevada yellow pine/mixed-conifer, @Koontz2020 found that greater variability in forest structure also increased the probability of high-severity fire. Here, we arrived at a combination of NDVI and NDSVI to describe the fuel connectivity of the annual grass invaded Great Basin sagebrush community to better reflect key differences in the physiognomies of forest and arid shrublands. In sagebrush shrublands, the fuel that contributes to large wildfires is a mixture of evergreen shrubs interspersed with herbaceous plants that remain green for only a portion of the growing season, and then become dry and straw-colored. Thus, both the live and dead fuel need to be taken into account in remote measurements of fuel connectivity.

***Management implications***

These results demonstrate that the strength of the grass-fire cycle in this system is controlled by measurable fire properties and ecosystem structural components. Land managers may be able to increase their chances of restoration success by using existing methods or developing novel ones that manipulate these components to weaken or even break the positive feedback cycle. This work provides further evidence that the post-fire annual grassland is a system where the degraded state represents an alternative species assemblage from that of the restoration target. Because the propagules of the original assemblage are no longer present, methods that rely on natural succession may not be sufficient [@Suding2004]. Estimating burn severity using satellite imagery may help land managers identify areas with a greater likelihood of successful seeding. Our results highlight the importance of prioritizing the preservation of existing native shrub cover and in particular policies that encourage land managers to maximize the preservation of unburned patches within the fire perimeter during the suppression of wildfires in this system [@Steenvoorden2019], as these are the primary sources of native propagules.

Livestock grazing can reduce fuel connectivity in uninvaded sagebrush [@Davies2010]. At the same time, livestock grazing can decrease the resistance to invasion by *B. tectorum* via negative effects on biological soil crust (BSC) [@chambers_resilience_2014; @Condon2018], and can reduce the survival of *Artemisia* seedlings that are not protected by shrub canopies [@Owens1992]. In wet years, targeted grazing at already invaded sites may reduce fuel connectivity and alleviate fire risk. Post-fire grazing may help reduce *B. tectorum* cover, but it may also exacerbate the problem by introducing cheatgrass in uninvaded sites [@Williamson2019] or increasing the already superior postfire dispersal of *B. tectorum* seeds [@Monty2013]. We suggest management approaches that are specifically tailored each year to the conditions of a given site, and targeting grazing only in already invaded areas to reduce *B. tectorum* cover where it may aid in native plant restoration.

Herbaceous cover in these dryland systems has high interannual variability [@Mahood2021]. Because the components of ecosystem structure and disturbance severity in positive feedback cycle described here are continuous mechanistic variables, it may be possible to develop theoretical models (*sensu* [@Ludwig1978]) to model the threshold of vegetation cover that will lead to high burn severity. These can then be applied in conjunction with near real time fuel loading forecasts [@Jones2021] to identify areas that are vulnerable to high severity fire, which can be used by land managers to take preemptive measures in high value areas.
