![a) Model convergence diagnostics. On the left is the effective sample size after adjusting for autocorrelation (ideally 4,000), and on the right is the Gelman diagnostic, ideally 1. b) Predictor variables that had at least 80% support. Variables with 95% support are outlined in black. The level of transparency corresponds to the level of support. c) Variance partitioning by species. Average across all species per variable is given in the legend. Species are ordered by prevalence.](images/jsdm_stuff.png)

![Panel a illustrates how we did not find convincing evidence that pre-fire cheagrass cover alone was predictive of any of the key components of our hypothesized feedback loop. Panel b shows how even pre-fire cheatgrass seed counts were not predictive of post-fire seed counts. Panel c shows the general change in structural composition, from woody to herbaceous, before and after the fire.](images/revresp1.png)
