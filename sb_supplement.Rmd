![Visual illustration of the relationship between fuel connectivity and burn severity. On the left, panel a shows the intershrub space invaded by annual grasses. The photo in panel b was taken in the exact same place two weeks later, days after all of the biomass was consumed by the fire. Panel C is a closeup of the soil surface, showing in more detail how the litter was also almost completely consumed by the fire. On the right, the photos in panels d and e were on opposite sides of a fire line in an area that had minimal annual grass invasion over a broad area, and thus lower fuel connectivity. Note the remaining plants and stumps in panel e and the presence of only partially consumed litter in panel f.](images/burnsev_fig.pdf){ width=50% }
