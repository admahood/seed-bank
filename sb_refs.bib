@article{Brooks2004,
abstract = {Plant invasions are widely recognized as significant threats to biodiversity conservation worldwide. One way invasions can affect native ecosystems is by changing fuel properties, which can in turn affect fire behavior and, ultimately, alter fire regime characteristics such as frequency, intensity, extent, type, and seasonality of fire. If the regime changes subsequently promote the dominance of the invaders, then an invasive plantâ€“fire regime cycle can be established. As more ecosystem components and interactions are altered, restoration of preinvasion conditions becomes more difficult. Restoration may require managing fuel conditions, fire regimes, native plant communities, and other ecosystem properties in addition to the invaders that caused the changes in the first place.We present a multiphase model describing the interrelationships between plant invaders and fire regimes, provide a system for evaluating the relative effects of invaders and prioritizing them for control, and recommend ways to restore pre- invasion fire regime properties.},

abstract = {Shrubs, bunchgrasses and biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are believed to contribute to site resistance to plant invasions in the presence of cattle grazing. Although fire is a concomitant disturbance with grazing, little is known regarding their combined impacts on invasion resistance. We are the first to date to test the idea that biotic communities mediate the effects of disturbance on site resistance. We assessed cover of Bromus tectorum, shrubs, native bunchgrasses, lichens and mosses in 99 burned and unburned plots located on similar soils where fires occurred between 12 and 23Â years before sampling. Structural equation modeling was used to test hypothesized relationships between environmental and disturbance characteristics, the biotic community and resistance to B. tectorum cover. Characteristics of fire and grazing did not directly relate to cover of B. tectorum. Relationships were mediated through shrub, bunchgrass and biocrust communities. Increased site resistance following fire was associated with higher bunchgrass cover and recovery of bunchgrasses and mosses with time since fire. Evidence of grazing was more pronounced on burned sites and was positively correlated with the cover of B. tectorum, indicating an interaction between fire and grazing that decreases site resistance. Lichen cover showed a weak, negative relationship with cover of B. tectorum. Fire reduced near-term site resistance to B. tectorum on actively grazed rangelands. Independent of fire, grazing impacts resulted in reduced site resistance to B. tectorum, suggesting that grazing management that enhances plant and biocrust communities will also enhance site resistance.},

@article{Davies2010,
abstract = {Livestock grazing potentially has substantial influence on fuel characteristics in rangelands around the globe. However, information quantifying the impacts of grazing on rangeland fuel characteristics is limited, and the effects of grazing on fuels are important because fuel characteristics are one of the primary factors determining risk, severity, continuity, and size of wildfires. We investigated the effects of long-term (70 yr) livestock grazing exclusion (nongrazed) and moderate levels of livestock grazing (grazed) on fuel accumulations, continuity, gaps, and heights in shrub-grassland rangelands. Livestock used the grazed treatment through 2008 and sampling occurred in mid- to late summer in 2009. Nongrazed rangelands had over twofold more herbaceous standing crop than grazed rangelands (P<0.01). Fuel accumulations on perennial bunchgrasses were approximately threefold greater in nongrazed than grazed treatments. Continuity of fuels in nongrazed compared to grazed treatments was also greater (P<0.05). The heights of perennial grass current year's and previous years' growth were 1.3-fold and 2.2-fold taller in nongrazed compared to grazed treatments (P<0.01). The results of this study suggest that moderate livestock grazing decreases the risk of wildfires in sagebrush steppe plant communities and potentially other semi-arid and arid rangelands. These results also suggest wildfires in moderately grazed sagebrush rangelands have decreased severity, continuity, and size of the burn compared to long-term nongrazed sagebrush rangelands. Because of the impacts fuels have on fire characteristics, moderate levels of grazing probably increase the efficiency of fire suppression activities. Because of the large difference between fuel characteristics in grazed and nongrazed sagebrush rangelands, we suggest that additional management impacts on fuels and subsequently fires need to be investigated in nonforested rangelands to protect native plant communities and prioritize management needs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society for Range Management.},

abstract = {Questions: How does the severity of prescribed fires affect vegetation and seed bank in a wetland? Location: A fire-prone reed swamp in northern Japan (250ha, 40Â°49'N, 141Â°22'E, <10m a.s.l.). Methods: Vegetation, biomass and seed bank were monitored for the 2yr after annual prescribed fires were discontinued. Plant communities were placed into three categories based on fire severity: high (H) - fire consumed litter completely; moderate (M) - fire removed standing litter but left wet fallen litter; and low (L) - fire incompletely removed standing litter and did not remove fallen litter. Soil samples were collected in autumn 2007 and early summer 2008, and germinable seed bank was investigated by greenhouse trials. Results: High fire severity increased diversity in the next growing season by the establishment of short herbs in the standing vegetation. The biomass of forbs and grasses was greater in H where Phragmites australis biomass was reduced. The density of seed bank was >30000seedsm-2 throughout all the treatments. Perennial plants were dominant in the vegetation, while annuals, biennials and rushes were dominant in the seed bank. Small seeds were more abundant in the soil than in the litter. Qualitative and quantitative similarities between seed bank and the vegetation were low, and tended to be higher in H. Conclusions: Fire contributed to the development of diverse standing vegetation via the positive effects on seed bank dynamics, and can be considered a tool to maintain species-rich marshes. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {Soil seed bank is an important source of resilience of plant communities who suffered disturbances. We analysed the effect of an intense fire in the soil seed bank of a semi-arid shrubland of C{\'{o}}rdoba Argentina. We asked if the fire affected seed abundance, floristic and functional composition of the soil seed bank at two different layers (0â€“5Â cm and 5â€“10Â cm), and if fire could compromise the role of the soil seed bank as a source of resilience for the vegetation. We collected soil samples from a burned site and from a control site that had not burned. Samples were installed in a greenhouse under controlled conditions. During 12Â months, we recorded all germinated seedlings. We compare soil seed bank with pre-fire vegetation in terms of floristic and functional composition. The high-intensity fire deeply affected the abundance of seeds in the soil, but it did not affect its floristic or functional composition. Floristic and functional composition of soil seed banks â€“ at burned and unburned sites- differed markedly from that of the pre-fire vegetation, although a previous study at the same site indicated high resilience after fire of this plant community. Our results indicate that resilience of this system is not strongly dependent on direct germination from seeds buried in the soil. Other sources of resilience, like colonization from neighbouring vegetation patches and resprouting from underground organs appear to gain relevance after an intense fire.},

@article{Liyanage2017,
abstract = {In fire-prone ecosystems, many species regenerate after fire from persistent soil seed banks. Species with physically dormant (PY) seeds have dormancy broken by fire-related heat. The magnitude of post-fire recruitment, to predict response to varying fire severity, is commonly estimated by testing dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds of fresh PY seeds. However, seeds spend years in the soil during the inter-fire period, and determining whether dormancy-breaking thresholds change over time is essential to accurately predict population persistence. Germination of four south-eastern Australian PY species from the Fabaceae family (Acacia linifolia, Aotus ericoides, Bossiaea heterophylla and Viminaria juncea) were studied. Dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds vary inter-specifically and the species represented either high or low dormancy-breaking threshold classes. Freshly collected seeds, and seeds that had been buried in the field or stored in dry laboratory conditions for 6 and 18 months were subjected to a fire-related range of heat treatments (40-100Â°C). Seed ageing increased germination response to heat treatments, effectively lowering the dormancy-breaking thresholds of three species. The fourth species, A. linifolia, initially had a relatively large non-dormant fraction which was lost as seeds aged, with older seeds then displaying PY broadly similar to the other study species. Patterns of threshold decay were species-specific, with the thresholds and viability of low-threshold species declining more rapidly than high-threshold species. The non-dormant fraction did not increase over time for any of our study species. Instead of increasing their non-dormant fraction, as is common in other vegetation types, these fire-prone PY species displayed a change of dormancy-breaking temperature thresholds. This is an important distinction, as maintaining dormancy during the inter-fire period is essential for population persistence. While changes in sensitivity to dormancy-breaking treatments have previously been reported as seeds age, our study provides the first test of changes to temperature thresholds, which increases the range of germination response from the seed bank under varying fire severity.},

abstract = {Bromus tectorum L., the most ubiquitous alien in steppe vegetation in the intermountain West of North America, entered British Columbia, Washington, and Utah ca. 1889-1894. By ca. 1928 the grass had reached its present distribution occupying much of the perennial grasslands in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada, Utah and British Columbia as native grasses dwindled with overgrazing and cultivation. In the process this cleistogamous winter annual may have competitively displaced both native colonizers (including cleistogamous us annual grasses) as well as the dominants of climax stands. The spread of B. tectorum demonstrates the degree of success an alien may achieve when preadaption, habitat alteration simultaneous with entry, unwitting conformation of agricultural practices to the plant's ecology and apparent susceptibility of the native flora to invasion, are all in phase. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {This study addressed the impacts of wildfire and, in particular, its severity on the seed bank of the litter/ash layer and the topsoil of a Mediterranean pine plantation (Pinus pinaster Ait.) in north-central Portugal. The study location was selected for presenting a homogeneous pine cover before the fire, on the one hand, and, on the other, heterogeneous patches with distinct degrees of damage to the pine crowns immediately after the fire. The experimental design involved the selection, from the opposite valley side, of three zones with adjacent strips of Low and High Canopy Consumption (L/HCC). Within each of these strips, a transect was laid out along which three plots were established at 10. m intervals. The same was done in the unburnt area immediately outside the fire perimeter. At each plot, samples were collected within the first two weeks after the fire to: (i) asses viable seed densities for three sampling layers, using the indirect method for a 10-month period; (ii) estimate maximum temperature reached (MTRs) at 0-3. cm depth, on the basis of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR). Fire severity at the plots was further determined by verifying, in situ, pine canopy consumption (FCC) as well as by measuring the minimum diameter of remaining shrub twigs (TDI). In comparison with the unburnt area, the recently burnt area as a whole revealed a substantial increase in overall densities of viable seeds. Seed bank composition, however, varied markedly within the burnt area but this could be explained reasonably well by differential effects of the wildfire associated with its severity, in terms of the two crown consumption classes as well as the TDI index but not the MTRs. The inclusion of the litter/ash layer and the separation of two soil depths were amply justified by providing clear support for the important role of fire severity, in particular for the two principal taxa (Calluna vulgaris and Erica spp., presumably mainly E. australis). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Milton2004,
abstract = {Grasses are important, but often overlooked, elements of the South African alien flora. Current information shows that 15% of the grass genera and 12% of grass species in southern Africa are naturalized aliens. Many of these species are invasive in other parts of the world, where they are reducing the biodiversity of indigenous communities, changing ecosystem processes, retarding ecosystem restoration and reducing profits from ranching and arable agriculture. Their spread has been facilitated by domestic livestock, disturbance, long-distance transport and nitrogen addition to soils. Control is complicated by abundant seed production, persistent seed banks, positive response to disturbance, a dearth of biocontrol research and, in some cases, by herbicide resistance. This review of the impacts of alien grasses in other parts of the world suggests that alien grasses will become increasingly prevalent in South Africa, and that more research, aimed at identifying appropriate management responses, would be justified.},

    abstract = { Seed banks contributed significantly to regeneration of early seral shrubs after clear-cutting and fall broadcast burning of dense coniferous forests of the Thuja plicata/Clintonia uniflora habitat type in northern Idaho. Seeds were separated from 36 samples of soil and surface organic matter from 15 uncut forest stands. Total seed density averaged 1151Â±1896 seeds/m2, and seed density for individual shrub species ranged from 1Â±3 to 690Â±1728 seeds/m2. Canopy cover of the "obligate" seed bank species, such as Ceanothus sanguineus and Prunus emarginata, was low or nonexistent in uncut forests, seed constancy and density in seed bank were high, and seedling regeneration on 2-year-old burns was abundant. Species that were "non-reliant" on seed banks, including Symphoricarpos albus and Rosa gymnocarpa, resprouted and no seedlings were found after burning. Response of "opportunistic" seed-bank species such as Rubus parviflorus and Rubus ursinus was intermediate; both seedling and sprout regeneration occurred after cutting and burning. These species existed in uncut stands both in the seed bank and in the understory. Burn severity affected germination and (or) seedling survival of Ceanothus sanguineus. Its percent canopy cover was greater on high-severity than on low-severity 2-year-old burns. }

@article{Nagel2004,
abstract = {To examine how global change could influence species invasions, we compared the responses of energetic processes and growth of invasive and native grass species to atmospheric CO2 enrichment in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem. Combined with its modest influence on photosynthetic activity, elevated atmospheric CO2 was associated with a significant reduction in the energetic cost of aboveground biomass construction in invasive Bromus madritensis spp. rubens (red brome) without a concurrent cost reduction in native Vulpia octoflora (six-weeks fescue). Consequently, the invasive grass species grew faster, grew bigger, and produced more seeds with atmospheric CO2 enrichment than the native grass species. As a physiological mechanism of invasive species success driven by CO2 enrichment, such alterations in biomass construction costs combined with increased photosynthetic activity could trigger a shift in the species composition of this ecosystem, and potentially that of other invaded ecosystems, toward increased invasive species dominance.},

@article{Palmer2018,
abstract = {Very high-severity fires are a component of many fire-prone ecosystems, yet are often viewed as detrimental to vegetation. However, species in such systems are likely to have adapted to persist under a fire regime that includes high-severity fires. We examined how fire severity affects post-fire recruitment and residual seed banks of Acacia species and whether severity may affect plant responses to fire intervals. Nine sites of either high or low burn severity were identified after a large-scale mixed-severity fire in Warrumbungle National Park, south-eastern Australia. Transects were used to sample above-ground woody plant density. Seed bank size was surveyed by soil extraction from two depths and manual searching for seeds. Residual soil seed bank and recruitment were compared across the two burn severities. Acacia seedling density was higher in areas burnt at high severity, indicating that increased severity triggers increased germination from the seed bank. Size of residual seed bank was smaller after high-severity fire, but varied between species, with few Acacia cheelii seeds remaining despite high above-ground abundance. In contrast, A. penninervis retained a small residual seed bank. There was little evidence of negative effects on populations of Acacia species after high-severity burns. However, we found that high fire severity may impact on the ability of a species to persist in response to a subsequent short fire interval. Fire management for maintaining biodiversity needs to consider other key aspects of the fire regime, including severity and season, rather than focusing solely on fire frequency.},

In this study, our aim was to determine the impact of M. minutiflora on native vegetation, as well as (using simulations of fire traits) on the characteristics of fires, in invaded areas of the Serra do Rola-Mo{\c{c}}a State Park (Parque Estadual da Serra do Rola-Mo{\c{c}}a, PESRM), a protected area where fires are frequent, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Our main results are that M. minutiflora considerably increases the amount of biomass, becoming the main combustible plant in the campo-cerrado (grassy-woody savanna) fires in the PESRM; that the native monocot biomass is inversely correlated with the M. minutiflora biomass, suggesting suppression of the native herbaceous stratum; that eudicots are diminished by M. minutiflora, both in number of individuals and number of species; and that fires are more severe in M. minutiflora-invaded areas.},

@article{Setterfield2010,
abstract = {Aim: This study aimed to quantify changes in fire severity resulting from the invasion of Australia's tropical savannas by the African grass Andropogon gayanus Kunth. (gamba grass). Location: Mesic savannas of the Northern Territory, Australia. Method: Byram's fire-line intensity (If), fuel load and architecture, and two post-fire indicators of fire intensity - scorch height (SH) and char height (CH) of woody vegetation - were determined for fires in native grass savanna and A. gayanus invaded savanna. Leaf scorch is the height at which the fire's radiant heat browns leaf tissue, and leaf char is the height that radiant heat blackens or consumes leaf tissue and provides an indirect measure of flame height. These data, and 5 years of similar data collected from the Kapalga Fire Project in Kakadu National Park, were used to develop empirical relationships between If and the post-fire indices of fire intensity. Results: A relationship between A. gayanus If and SH could not be developed because complete canopy scorch occurred in most A. gayanus fires, even at low If. In contrast, A. gayanus If was strongly correlated with CH. This empirical relationship was substantially different from that for native grass fires. For a given If, there was a significantly greater CH in invaded sites. This increase in radiant heat is attributable to the increased biomass (mean 3.6 t ha-1 in native grasses compared to 11.6 t ha-1 in A. gayanus) and height (approximately 0.5 m in native grasses compared to 4 m in A. gayanus) of the standing fine fuel. Main conclusion: Andropogon gayanus invasion resulted in substantial changes in fire behaviour. This has important regional implications owing to the current (10,000-15,000 km2) and predicted (380,000 km2) area of invasion and the negative consequences for the native savanna biota that has evolved with frequent but relatively low-intensity fire. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Arid ecosystems, which occupy about 20% of the earth's terrestrial surface area, have been predicted to be one of the most responsive ecosystem types to elevated atmospheric CO2 and associated global climate change. Here we show, using free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology in an intact Mojave Desert ecosystem, that new shoot production of a dominant perennial shrub is doubled by a 50% increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration in a high rainfall year. However, elevated CO2 does not enhance production in a drought year. We also found that above-ground production and seed rain of an invasive annual grass increases more at elevated CO2 than in several species of native annuals. Consequently, elevated CO2 might enhance the long-term success and dominance of exotic annual grasses in the region. This shift in species composition in favour of exotic annual grasses, driven by global change, has the potential to accelerate the fire cycle, reduce biodiversity and alter ecosystem function in the deserts of western North America.},

@article{Staal2020,
abstract = {Tropical forests modify the conditions they depend on through feedbacks at different spatial scales. These feedbacks shape the hysteresis (history-dependence) of tropical forests, thus controlling their resilience to deforestation and response to climate change. Here, we determine the emergent hysteresis from local-scale tipping points and regional-scale forest-rainfall feedbacks across the tropics under the recent climate and a severe climate-change scenario. By integrating remote sensing, a global hydrological model, and detailed atmospheric moisture tracking simulations, we find that forest-rainfall feedback expands the geographic range of possible forest distributions, especially in the Amazon. The Amazon forest could partially recover from complete deforestation, but may lose that resilience later this century. The Congo forest currently lacks resilience, but is predicted to gain it under climate change, whereas forests in Australasia are resilient under both current and future climates. Our results show how tropical forests shape their own distributions and create the climatic conditions that enable them.},

abstract = {The persistence of wildlife species in fire-prone ecosystems is under increasing pressure from global change, including alterations in fire regimes caused by climate change. However, unburned islands might act to mitigate negative effects of fire on wildlife populations by providing habitat in which species can survive and recolonize burned areas. Nevertheless, the characteristics of unburned islands and their role as potential refugia for the postfire population dynamics of wildlife species remain poorly understood. We used a newly developed unburned island database of the northwestern United States from 1984 to 2014 to assess the postfire response of the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a large gallinaceous bird inhabiting the sagebrush ecosystems of North America, in which wildfires are common. Specifically, we tested whether prefire and postfire male attendance trends at mating locations (leks) differed between burned and unburned areas, and to what extent postfire habitat composition at multiple scales could explain such trends. Using time-series of male counts at leks together with spatially explicit fire history information, we modeled whether male attendance was negatively affected by fire events. Results revealed that burned leks often exhibit sustained decline in male attendance, whereas leks within unburned islands or >1.5Â km away from fire perimeters tend to show stable or increasing trends. Analyses of postfire habitat composition further revealed that sagebrush vegetation height within 0.8Â km around leks, as well elevation within 0.8Â km, 6.4Â km, and 18Â km around leks, had a positive effect on male attendance trends. Moreover, the proportion of the landscape with cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) cover >8% had negative effects on male attendance trends within 0.8Â km, 6.4Â km, and 18Â km of leks, respectively. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that maintaining areas of unburned vegetation within and outside fire perimeters may be crucial for sustaining sage-grouse populations following wildfire. The role of unburned islands as fire refugia requires more attention in wildlife management and conservation planning because their creation, protection, and maintenance may positively affect wildlife population dynamics in fire-prone ecosystems.},

Cheeagrass (Bromus tectorum L.), an introduced annual, increases fire frequencies by creating a more continuous fuelbed. More-frequent fires and reduced patchiness prevent, or greatly retard, normal vegetation replacement sequences leading to vegetation resembling less-frequently burned areas.

abstract = {Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) has increased the extent and frequency of fire and negatively affected native plant and animal species across the Intermountain West (USA). However, the strengths of association between cheatgrass occurrence or abundance and fire, livestock grazing, and precipitation are not well understood. We used 14 years of data from 417 sites across 10,000 km2 in the central Great Basin to assess the effects of the foregoing predictors on cheatgrass occurrence and prevalence (i.e., given occurrence, the proportion of measurements in which the species was detected). We implemented hierarchical Bayesian models and considered covariates for which > 0.90 or < 0.10 of the posterior predictive mass for the regression coefficient â‰¥ 0 as strongly associated with the response variable. Similar to previous research, our models indicated that fire is a strong, positive predictor of cheatgrass occurrence and prevalence. Models fitted to all sample points and to only unburned points indicated that grazing and the proportion of years grazed were strong positive predictors of occurrence and prevalence. In contrast, in models restricted to burned points, prevalence was high, but decreased slightly as the proportion of years grazed increased (relative to other burned points). Prevalence of cheatgrass also decreased as the prevalence of perennial grasses increased. Cheatgrass occurrence decreased as elevation increased, but prevalence within the elevational range of cheatgrass increased as median winter precipitation, elevation, and solar exposure increased. Our novel time-series data and results indicate that grazing corresponds with increased cheatgrass occurrence and prevalence regardless of variation in climate, topography, or community composition, and provide no support for the notion that contemporary grazing regimes or grazing in conjunction with fire can suppress cheatgrass.},
