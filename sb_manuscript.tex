\subsection{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

Persistent ecosystem state changes can result when multiple drivers that
affect an ecosystem's function interact. For example, exotic plant
invasions can alter ecosystem structure, and altered structure can
change the likelihood of a disturbance, the properties of a disturbance
and the capacity of the system to recover after a disturbance. Altered
disturbance regimes can ultimately lead to changes in species
composition and losses of biodiversity. In the sagebrush ecosystems in
the western United States, widespread annual grass invasion has
increased fuel connectivity, which increases the size and spatial
contiguity of fires, leading to post-fire monocultures of introduced
annual grasses (IAG). The novel grassland state is persistent, and more
likely to promote large fires than the shrubland it replaced. But the
mechanisms by which pre-fire invasion and fire occurrence are linked to
higher post-fire flammability are not fully understood.

Here, we hypothesized that fuel connectivity would increase burn
severity, which would then have affect seed bank survivorship to favor
IAG, leading to increased post-fire fuel connectivity. We found that
pre-fire fuel connectivity increased burn severity. We then used a
Bayesian joint species distribution model to examine how burn severity
affected the proportion of IAG in the seed bank, and found that higher
burn severity had mostly positive effects on the occurrence of IAG and
another non-native species, and mostly negative or neutral relationships
with all other species. Finally, we found that the abundance of IAG
seeds in the seedbank immediately post-fire had a positive effect on the
fuel connectivity 3 years after fire, completing a positive feedback
promoting IAG. These results demonstrate that the strength of the
positive feedback is controlled by measurable characteristics of
ecosystem structure, composition and disturbance, and each node in the
loop is affected independently by multiple global change drivers. It is
possible that these characteristics can be modeled to predict threshold
behavior and inform management actions to mitigate the undesirable
effects of the grass-fire cycle, perhaps via targeted restoration
applications or pre-fire fuel treatments.

\subsection{1. Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Ecosystems around the world are being affected simultaneously by
multiple facets of global change. For example, changes in land use can
facilitate exotic plant invasions
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Allan2015}{Allan et al. 2015}), which can alter
ecosystem structure (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Davies2013}{Davies and Nafus
2013}). Altered structure can change the likelihood of a disturbance,
the properties of a disturbance and the capacity of the system to
recover after a disturbance. Global climate change can also affect the
magnitude of disturbances (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Parks2020}{S. A. Parks
and Abatzoglou 2020}), and as well as the ability of ecosystems to
recover after disturbance (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rother2015}{Rother,
Veblen, and Furman 2015}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-Davis2019}{Davis et al.
2019}). The combined effects of global change forces on structure,
function and disturbance can cascade and interact. For example, while
burn severity is primarily controlled by vegetation structure
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Koontz2020}{Koontz et al. 2020}), it also
increases with temperature and aridity
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Parks2020}{S. A. Parks and Abatzoglou 2020}).
These forces can ultimately lead to permanent compositional change,
biodiversity losses and the loss of ecosystem services
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ratajczak2018}{Ratajczak et al. 2018};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mahood2019}{Mahood and Balch 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mahood2021}{Mahood et al. 2022}) due to internal,
self-reinforcing mechanisms that arise from those structural and
functional changes which then maintain an alternative stable state
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Scheffer2003}{Marten Scheffer and Carpenter
2003}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-Ratajczak2018}{Ratajczak et al. 2018}).

There is a long history of univariate time series observations that show
sudden state changes (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Scheffer2003}{Marten
Scheffer and Carpenter 2003}), and these have informed the development
of theories that help us understand how systems of any type can change
state suddenly, and exist in persistent alternative stable states
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Scheffer2015}{Marten Scheffer et al. 2015};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ratajczak2018}{Ratajczak et al. 2018}). These
theories typically focus on a single driver affecting a single variable
that represents the system's state
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Scheffer2015}{Marten Scheffer et al. 2015}).
Correlative evidence of alternative stable states has been documented at
broad scales in tropical ecosystems, where forests, savannas and
grasslands are considered alternative stable states because they are
floristically distinct (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Aleman2020}{Aleman et al.
2020}) and cluster around static values of woody cover (80, 30 and 0
percent) while occurring along overlapping ranges of precipitation
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hirota2011}{Hirota et al. 2011};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Staver2011}{Staver, Archibald, and Levin 2011}).
In the forested state there is thought to be a self-reinforcing,
positive feedback between evapotranspiration and tree cover
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Staal2020}{Staal et al. 2020}), while the
grassland and savanna states are thought to be maintained by feedbacks
between grass flammability and fire occurrence
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-DAntonio1992}{D'Antonio and Vitousek 1992};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Staver2011}{Staver, Archibald, and Levin 2011}).
Alternative stable states are believed to be widespread
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Scheffer2001}{M. Scheffer et al. 2001}), but
outside of greenhouse and laboratory microcosm experiments
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schroder2005}{Schröder, Persson, and De Roos
2005}), are difficult to experimentally demonstrate at broader scales.
One of the reasons for this is that ecological systems are much more
complex than a simple bivariate system with a single driver and a single
response. There may be multiple drivers, and the state is the product of
interactions between organisms and their immediate environment, as well
as countless inter- and intraspecific interactions.

A classic example of an alternative stable state is the invasion of
\emph{Bromus tectorum} L. and other introduced annual grasses in the
Great Basin of the western United States. Here, the interaction of
exotic plant invasions, fire (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Balch2013}{Balch et
al. 2013}) and grazing
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Williamson2019}{Williamson et al. 2019}) has
resulted in the degradation or loss of over half of Wyoming big
sagebrush (\emph{Artemisia tridentata} ssp. \emph{wyomingensis} Beetle
\& Young) ecosystems (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Davies2011}{Davies et al.
2011}). In these systems, the space between shrubs is typically composed
of bare ground covered in biological soil crust and dotted with
perennial plants. The lack of fuel connectivity limits fire spread, with
a pre-colonial fire regime of infrequent, patchy fires
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Baker2006}{Baker 2006};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bukowski2013}{Bukowski and Baker 2013}). Annual
grass invasion increases fuel connectivity while decreasing fuel
moisture (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Davies2013}{Davies and Nafus 2013}),
leading to increased fire size and frequency
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Knapp1996}{Knapp 1996};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Balch2013}{Balch et al. 2013}). After fire, the
landscape is typically dominated by introduced annual grasses.
\textbf{But in order to understand how fire drives the persistence of
the grassland state, the mechanisms by which fire benefits the
introduced annual grass must be understood.}

\protect\hyperlink{ref-Petraitis1999}{Petraitis and Latham}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Petraitis1999}{1999}) posited that the
maintenance of alternate species assemblages requires first a
disturbance that removes the species from the initial assemblage and
second the arrival of the species of the alternate assemblage. One
understudied mechanism that may explain both is the interaction between
the species composition of the soil seed bank and burn severity. Because
the invading species are annual, and most of the native plants are seed
obligates, the seed is the key life history stage that fire must act
upon to benefit the invading plants. Seeds and seedlings are
particularly vulnerable to climate, competition and disturbance
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Enright2015}{Enright et al. 2015}). Warmer and
drier conditions simultaneously reduce recruitment, growth, and survival
of seeds and seedlings (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Enright2015}{Enright et
al. 2015}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-Schlaepfer2014}{Schlaepfer, Lauenroth,
and Bradford 2014}), while also increasing burn severity
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Parks2020}{S. A. Parks and Abatzoglou 2020}). In
fire prone ecosystems, seed obligate species typically have strategies
to cope with fires that burn at different severities
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Maia2012}{Maia et al. 2012};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2016}{Wright, Latz, and Zuur 2016};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Palmer2018}{Palmer, Denham, and Ooi 2018}). Soil
heating from fire affects the response of vegetation to fire
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gagnon2015}{Gagnon et al. 2015}), including the
capacity of seeds to remain viable after fire
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Humphrey2001}{Humphrey and Schupp 2001}). High
severity fire can affect species that use the seedbank positively
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kimura2011}{Kimura and Tsuyuzaki 2011}),
negatively (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Heydari2017}{Heydari et al. 2017}),
or have no effect (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lipoma2018}{Lipoma, Funes, and
Díaz 2018}), depending on species-specific adaptations. Both the depth
of the burn and fire temperature can affect subsequent recovery by seed
germination (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Morgan1988}{Morgan and
Neuenschwander 1988}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-Schimmel1996}{Schimmel and
Granström 1996}), as well as seed mortality and physical seed dormancy
mechanisms (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Liyanage2017}{Liyanage and Ooi
2017}).

In addition to size and frequency, exotic plant invasions can alter fire
temperature (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Brooks2004}{Brooks et al. 2004};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jones2015}{R. O. Jones et al. 2015}) and burn
severity (or the proportion of biomass burned
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Keeley2009}{Keeley 2009})). While in many cases
fires that burn at higher temperatures will also consume more biomass,
grass fires may not always have such a relationship. Direct measurements
have shown that \emph{B. tectorum} burns at low temperatures
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Beckstead2011}{Beckstead et al. 2011};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Germino2016}{Germino, Chambers, and Brown 2016}),
but because it also increases horizontal fuel connectivity
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Davies2013}{Davies and Nafus 2013}), it leads to
more contiguously burned areas and therefore higher burn severity,
despite lower fire temperatures. In order for an annual like \emph{B.
tectorum} it to benefit from fire, which it clearly does
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Balch2013}{Balch et al. 2013};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mahood2019}{Mahood and Balch 2019}), it would
need enough viable seeds in the post-fire landscape to achieve a fitness
benefit and become well-represented in the post-fire plant assemblage
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bond1995}{Bond and Midgley 1995}). If the fire
is patchy, this can happen through post-fire seed dispersal, and
\emph{B. tectorum} seeds have been shown to have increased dispersal
distances after fire (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Monty2013}{Monty, Brown,
and Johnston 2013}). Without unburned patches, seeds must survive the
fire. If the increase in fuel connectivity caused by \emph{B. tectorum}
increases the severity of fire, it stands to reason that burn severity
would then influence the community composition of the post-fire seed
bank in a way that facilitates the post-fire dominance of \emph{B.
tectorum}. In other words, an area with high burn severity should have a
lower occurrence of viable seeds of native species, and a higher
occurrence of the seeds of fire-tolerant introduced annual plants. This
would lead to the dominance of introduced annual grasses and would
result in higher fuel connectivity, closing the positive feedback loop.
Plants that are not adapted to frequent fire would be less likely to
produce seeds that are adapted to surviving fire, or dispersal
mechanisms to take advantage of the resources available immediately
after fire (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Keeley2011}{Keeley et al. 2011}). To
our knowledge, despite several studies on the relationship between fire
occurrence and the seed bank in this system
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Young1975}{Young and Evans 1975};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hassan1986}{Hassan and West 1986};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Humphrey2001}{Humphrey and Schupp 2001};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Boudell2002}{Boudell, Link, and Johansen 2002};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Barga2018}{Barga and Leger 2018}), no studies to
date have examined this potential effect of burn severity on the seed
bank in this system.

Here, we collected soil cores from 14 locations along the perimeter of a
large fire (the Hot Pot fire, \textasciitilde50,000 ha) immediately
after it was extinguished, in northern Nevada in July 2016. Because it
burned a large area in only three days, we could sample a broad area
while being reasonably certain that the climatic conditions during the
fire were the same at all sites. Because we collected our samples
immediately after the fire was extinguished, we felt confident that the
seed bank samples did not contain seeds deposited by post-fire
dispersal. We put the samples in cold storage and germinated the seeds
from those cores in a greenhouse the following spring. In spring 2017
and fall 2019 we collected information on vegetation structure and
diversity at each location. We hypothesized that (H1) Pre-fire fuel
connectivity would be positively related to burn severity; (H2) burn
severity would increase the occurrence probability of introduced annual
species in the seed bank and reduce the occurrence probability of native
species; (H2a) increased fuel connectivity brought on by the invasion of
annual grasses already depleted the diversity of the soil seed bank
before the fire occurred; (H3) the abundance of post-fire \emph{B.
tectorum} seeds would be positively related to post-fire fuel
connectivity. In addition, because in our study system post-fire sites
are often near monocultures of \emph{B. tectorum}, we hypothesized that
(H4) high post-fire fuel connectivity of those near-monocultures would
result in lower aboveground species diversity due to competitive
pressure.

\subsection{2. Methods}\label{methods}}

\emph{2.1 Study Area}

The study was conducted in north-central Nevada the day after a large
fire (the Hot Pot Fire) was extinguished (Appendix S1, Fig. S1). The Hot
Pot Fire burned just over 50,000 hectares in less than a week. The
pre-fire landcover was predominantly \emph{B. tectorum} and Wyoming big
sagebrush plant communities. The fire occurred after the early season
plants, including \emph{B. tectorum} and \emph{Poa secunda} J. Presl,
the most abundant native understory species, had gone to seed, and
before the late season species, including Wyoming big sagebrush, had
produced flowers. Thus we were able to isolate the effect of the fire
without any confounding effects of post-fire seed dispersal, while
achieving a broad spatial extent. The sites we sampled ranged from 1,397
to 1,607 meters in elevation.

\emph{2.2 Seed Bank Sampling}

In early July 2016, we collected samples of the soil seed bank at
fourteen locations the day after the Hot Pot fire was contained. Each
site was located at the perimeter of the fire where it was clearly
delineated by a bulldozer line or in one case a narrow dirt road. Eleven
sites were mature sagebrush communities with no history of fire since at
least 1984. Three plots had previously burned in 1984 according to the
Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) fire history
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Eidenshink2007}{Eidenshink et al. 2007}) and had
high cover of \emph{B. tectorum}, but still had scattered sagebrush
cover. We used a metal stake to mark paired burned and unburned sampling
locations on each side of the perimeter, 10 m from the nearest evidence
of anthropogenic disturbance (i.e.~bulldozer effects, footprints)
associated with active fire suppression along the perimeter. Within 3 m
of each marker, we extracted 12, 6 cm deep, 5 cm diameter, soil cores.
Seeds of sagebrush generally do not fall far (\textless30 m) from their
parent plants in this system
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Shinneman2016}{Shinneman and McIlroy 2016}), and
so they are not uniformly distributed
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Boudell2002}{Boudell, Link, and Johansen 2002}).
In addition, seeds from \emph{B. tectorum}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Young1975}{Young and Evans 1975}) and
\emph{Artemisia} have different germination rates based on the
micro-site they find themselves in (i.e.~under a shrub or in the bare
ground between shrubs, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Eckert1986}{Eckert et al.
1986}). To account for these potentially confounding effects, we placed
half of the core locations under shrubs, and half in shrub interspaces.
In the burned areas, it was obvious where shrubs had been located. Even
when they were completely incinerated, their imprint remained on the
soil surface (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bechtold2007}{Bechtold and Inouye
2007}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-Germino2018}{Germino et al. 2018}). To
examine the effect of seed depth, we divided each soil core into 0-2 cm
and 2-6 cm depths. Litter was aggregated with the 0-2 cm samples.
Samples were then placed in cold storage (\textasciitilde2 deg C) for 3
months (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Meyer2013}{Meyer, Monsen, and Mcarthur
2013}). At all sites, to be sure that we were at a site where sagebrush
germination could occur we checked for first year germinants on the
unburned side (we found them at all sites), and to ensure that there
were no confounding effects of post-fire seed dispersal, we determined
whether or not the sagebrush were flowering (they were not flowering at
all sites), and recorded species occupancy for all aboveground plant
species.

We followed the methodology of Ter Heert et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Heerdt1996}{1996}) to germinate the seeds. Each
sample was run through 0.2 mm sieve, and spread in a 3-5 mm layer over
the top of 1 - 4 pots. These pots were filled 3 cm deep with potting
soil, topped by a thin layer of sand. Pots were watered as needed to
stay at field capacity. Every week emerging germinants were identified,
counted and removed. Most of the germination occurred within 6 weeks,
and after 8 weeks we ended the germination assay.

\emph{2.3 Post-Fire Vegetation Sampling}

We sampled the vegetative occupancy and cover in May 2017, the growing
season immediately after the fire and again in September 2019. At each
location, we established 50m transects starting at the boundary of the
burned and unburned sides of the perimeter, running perpendicular to the
fire perimeter, and marked the transect ends with rebar. We measured the
occupancy and abundance of all plant species by measuring cover of every
species in 0.1 m\(^2\) quadrats spaced every 5 m along each transect. We
used the line intercept method to measure shrub cover and herbaceous
plant cover along the transect. Both live and dead plants were included
in these measurements. Total vegetation cover (TVC) was defined as the
sum of herbaceous plant cover and shrub cover.

\emph{2.4 Estimating Burn Severity with Landsat 8 OLI}

We downloaded the ``fire bundle'' of the Hot Pot fire from www.mtbs.gov.
This included cloud-free Landsat 8 scenes collected before the Hot Pot
fire, and already calculated layers of the Differenced Normalized Burn
Ratio (dNBR, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Miller2009}{J. D. Miller et al.
2009}). Because our sites were generally within 10 meters of the burn
perimeter, The pixels directly intersecting the plot locations were
likely to be mixed pixels (i.e.~containing burned and unburned ground).
To minimize this effect, we extracted all the dNBR values within a 120
meter buffer of each seed bank plot for pixels whose centroids fell
inside of the fire perimeter and calculated the mean.

\emph{2.5 Statistical Analysis}

Our statistical analysis centered around trying to understand each
component of the positive feedback loop posited by the 4 hypotheses
described above. In order to understand how pre-fire fuel connectivity
influenced burn severity (H1), we used total vegetation cover (TVC) from
two separate data sources as a proxy for fuel connectivity, and created
separate linear models with TVC as the predictor variable and burn
severity (dNBR, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Miller2009}{J. D. Miller et al.
2009}) as the response variable. With the field data we collected, we
created an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear model with burn severity
as the dependent variable and TVC (defined as shrub cover plus
herbaceous plant cover from the unburned side of the paired plots),
elevation and aspect as independent variables.

We were concerned that because our data were collected at the edge of
the fire, the burn severity calculated at each point may have included
partially burned pixels. So, as a supplement, we examined the same
relationship by creating a model of TVC using Landsat Thematic Mapper
(TM) surface reflectance data using TVC from the Bureau of Land
Management's Assessment, Inventory and Monitoring dataset (AIM,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-AIM}{U.S. Department of Interior 2018}). The AIM
dataset contained 813 sampling locations within the Central Basin and
Range ecoregion (\protect\hyperlink{ref-CEC2006}{Commission for
Environmental Cooperation 2006}) that were visited by BLM field crews
between 2011 and 2015. They were mostly sampled once but there were some
repeats, for 1,117 total measurements. For each of these points, we
extracted the surface reflectance values of each Landsat band for the
sampling year near peak biomass using a cloud-free scene from May or
early June. Then, we used those surface reflectance values to calculate
various vegetation indexes (Appendix S1: Table S1), including the Green
Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (Green NDVI, Equation 1), and
Normalized Differenced Senesced Vegetation Index (NDSVI, Equation 2). We
used these indexes to create generalized linear model of TVC with a beta
distribution. For this and all linear models, we started with the
largest possible model and used backwards selection following the
methodology of \protect\hyperlink{ref-Zuur2009}{Zuur et al.}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Zuur2009}{2009}). We used the final reduced
model to create a layer of predicted TVC for the study area for the
pre-fire scene, and extracted both our predictions of TVC and dNBR of
the fire from 1000 regularly-spaced points within the fire perimeter.
Finally, to quantify the effect of TVC on burn severity, we created an
OLS linear model with our modeled TVC and its second-order polynomial as
predictor variables and burn severity as the response variable.

\textbf{Equation 1:} \(Green~NDVI = \frac{NIR - Green}{NIR + Green}\)

\textbf{Equation 2:} \(NDSVI = \frac{SWIR_1 - Red}{SWIR_1 + Red}\)

To examine how burn severity affected the community composition of the
seed bank (H2), we created a joint species distribution model (JSDM) in
a Bayesian framework (\protect\hyperlink{ref-HMSC}{Tikhonov et al.
2020}) for the occurrence of all species germinated from the seed bank
that were found at more than one location. We created four Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains, each consisting of 150,000 iterations. We
discarded the first 50,000 iterations for each chain and then recorded
every 100th for a total of 1,000 posterior samples per chain, and 4,000
total. We assessed model convergence using the effective sample size and
the potential scale reduction factor
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gelman1992}{Gelman, Rubin, and others 1992}). We
used the model to predict the probability of occurrence of germinable
seeds of a given species along a gradient of burn severity. We included
burn severity, elevation, aspect, pre-fire seedbank diversity and soil
depth as independent variables.

To account for the possibility of H2a as a confounding factor, we
included the Shannon-Weaver diversity index
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Shannon1949}{Shannon and Weaver 1949}) in the
paired, unburned seed bank samples as one of the predictor variables in
our JSDM. We also created OLS models with the unburned species richness
and Shannon-Weaver diversity index predicted by prefire fuel
connectivity, with the expectation that pre-fire fuel connectivity would
have had a negative effect on the prefire seedbank diversity. To examine
how community composition and burn severity then affected subsequent
fuel connectivity (H3), we created OLS models with fuel connectivity
three years post-fire as the dependent variable, and burn severity, seed
counts for \emph{B. tectorum}, \emph{P. secunda} and other species,
elevation, aspect, depth, and alpha diversity as independent variables.
To examine how the resulting fuel connectivity was related to
biodiversity (H4), we used the diversity data and connectivity data that
we collected in 2019 to create a Poisson GLM with number of species
encountered aboveground at each plot location as the dependent variable,
as well as an OLS linear model with the Shannon-Weaver index
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Shannon1949}{Shannon and Weaver 1949}) as a
dependent variable. We used fuel connectivity, elevation, and aspect as
independent variables.

All analyses were done in R (\protect\hyperlink{ref-R}{R Core Team
2020}). Data and code to recreate the analysis are freely available at

\subsection{3. Results}\label{results}}

We found support for each hypothesized component of the positive
feedback loop. For H1, the most parsimonious model for our \emph{in
situ} observations had only TVC as the predictor, which had a weak
positive relationship with burn severity (\(\beta\) = 2.4, p = 0.083,
R\(^2\) = 0.27, Figure 1a, Appendix 1: Table S2). For our remotely
sensed analysis, our most parsimonious model of TVC explained 35\% of
the variation and had Green NDVI, NDSVI and their interaction as
predictors (Appendix S1: Table S2). Our model of dNBR using the
predicted TVC within the fire perimeter as a predictor of dNBR explained
42\% of the variation and the relationship between TVC and burn severity
was positive and significant (p \textless\textless{} 0.01, Figure 1a,
Appendix S1: Table S2).

The vast majority of seeds that germinated in the greenhouse were the
two most common grass species, \emph{P secunda} and \emph{B. tectorum}
(Appendix S1: Table S3). Eight forb species were found in more than one
location, and these 10 prevalent species are those that were used in our
JSDM. Burned plots had an average of 34 \(\pm\) 32 total seeds in the
top 2 cm, and 12 \(\pm\) 14 in the bottom 4 cm. Unburned plots had an
average of 299 \(\pm\) 170 in the top 2 cm and 59 \(\pm\) 29 in the
bottom 4 cm (Appendix S1: Fig. S2). For H2, the JSDM converged well
(Appendix S1: Fig S3). Gelman diagnostics all very close to 1 and the
effective sample size centered on 4,000. Elevation had the most
significant effects on individual species and explained the most
variance on average (36\%). Burn severity explained 23\% of the variance
on average and was supported at the 95\% level for 5 species. For the
introduced species, the predictions along a gradient of burn severity
were positive for \emph{B. tectorum}, \emph{Sisymbrium altissimum} L.
and \emph{Lepidium perfoliatum} L., and negative for \emph{Ceratocephala
testiculata} and \emph{Alyssum desertorum} Stapf. For native species,
the effect of burn severity on occurrence was positive for \emph{A.
tridentata}, neutral for \emph{P. secunda} and negative for the
remaining species. Testing H2a revealed a positive relationship between
pre-fire aboveground species diversity and pre-fire fuel connectivity,
and so we felt it was reasonable to rule out pre-fire fuel connectivity
as a confounding factor for H2.

For H3, we found that, after accounting for elevation, pre-fire
aboveground richness, and the number of \emph{P. secunda} seeds, the
number of \emph{B. tectorum} seeds in the postfire seedbank was
positively associated with the fuel connectivity in 2019 (\(\beta\) =
0.54, p = 0.01, Adj R\(^2\) = 0.75,Figure 1c, Appendix S1: Table S2).
For H4 the most parsimonious model (Adj R\(^2\) = 0.89, Appendix S1:
Table S2) had elevation, aspect, fuel connectivity and an interaction
between elevation and fuel connectivity as predictors of aboveground
Shannon-Weaver alpha diversity. Fuel connectivity was negatively
associated with Shannon-Weaver diversity (\(\beta\) = -0.28, p=0.004,
Figure 1d).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\subsection{4. Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Here we document the mechanisms by which changes in ecosystem structure
brought on by invasion can lead to cascading effects on ecosystem
function and composition via changes in the disturbance regime. It has
already been shown that \emph{B. tectorum} invasion increases fire
frequency (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Balch2013}{Balch et al. 2013}), and
from this we can infer the existence of a grass-fire cycle. However, in
order to truly consider an annual grass-fire cycle to be maintained by
self-reinforcing feedbacks, the mechanisms by which fire occurrence is
linked to higher post-fire flammability must be understood. The
interaction between burn severity and seed bank composition documented
here may explain that link. Prior work has shown that annual grass
invasion increases fuel connectivity by filling in shrub interspaces
with a contiguous bed of fine fuels
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Davies2013}{Davies and Nafus 2013}). This change
in the spatial distribution of fine fuels has been associated with
larger and more frequent fires (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Balch2013}{Balch
et al. 2013}). Here, we found higher fuel connectivity (via TVC)
increased burn severity (H1, Figure 1a). Higher burn severity was
associated with an increased occurrence of introduced annuals in the
seedbank and a decreased occurrence of native plants (H2, Figure 1b).
Finally, greater abundance of \emph{B. tectorum} seeds in the post-fire
seedbank resulted in higher post-fire fuel connectivity (H3, Figure 1c).
In addition, we found evidence that high post-fire fuel connectivity was
associated with lower aboveground diversity (H4, Figure 1d). This
suggests that during inter-fire intervals, there may be additional
mechanisms (e.g.~competition, altered ecohydrology) maintaining the
post-fire, annual grass-dominated species assemblage.

The difference in species composition before and after fire explains an
apparent contradiction in results between H2a (positive relationship
between pre-fire fuel connectivity and diversity) and H4 (negative
relationship between post-fire fuel connectivity and diversity). Most
plot locations had mature canopies of native shrubs with the inter-shrub
space occupied mostly by native bunchgrasses and forbs, with no fire
occurrence since 1984. Even in locations with high annual grass cover
between shrubs, shrubs provide ecosystem structural heterogeneity and
islands of fertility (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Doescher1984}{Doescher,
Miller, and Winward 1984}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bechtold2007}{Bechtold
and Inouye 2007}), and perennial natives that may have been established
before invasion have deep roots established that allow for the avoidance
of competition for water with shallow-rooted annuals
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gibbens2001}{Gibbens and Lenz 2001};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ottaviani2020}{Ottaviani et al. 2020}). This may
provide enough niche compartmentalization to allow native plants to
persist in spite of the invasion. Three years after fire, almost all of
the plots were dominated by introduced annuals, and lacked any
structural heterogeneity. Thus native plants may have been be able to
persist via niche compartmentalization after the initial invasion, but
fire burned away most of the seeds (Appendix S1, Fig. S1) and removed
all of the structural benefits, and microclimatic refugia that shrub
cover provides. In this clean slate post-fire environment, the altered
species composition of the seedbank and superior post-fire dispersal of
\emph{B. tectorum} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Monty2013}{Monty, Brown, and
Johnston 2013}) allow the process of interspecific competition to be
dominant (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schlaepfer2014}{Schlaepfer, Lauenroth,
and Bradford 2014}).

\textbf{\emph{Global implications}}

Understanding how different facets of global change create multiple
mechanisms that act in concert to drive ecosystem transformation will
provide important insights about ecosystem change on a global
scale.Eecological systems are much more complex than a simple bivariate
system with a single driver and a single response. The system studied
here has at least three external processes that influence the positive
feedback loop we documented. First, land use change in the form of the
introduction of livestock grazing facilitates invasion
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ponzetti2007}{Ponzetti, Mccune, and Pyke 2007};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Williamson2019}{Williamson et al. 2019}). The
introduction of exotic grasses increases fuel connectivity
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Davies2013}{Davies and Nafus 2013}), which we
document affects burn severity, and finally increasing temperatures due
to climate change both increase burn severity
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Parks2020}{S. A. Parks and Abatzoglou 2020})
while simultaneously decreasing seed viability and seedling survival
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Schlaepfer2014}{Schlaepfer, Lauenroth, and
Bradford 2014}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-Enright2015}{Enright et al.
2015}). Finally, CO\(_2\) enrichment may preferentially enhance biomass
(i.e.~higher fuel connectivity) and seed production of annual grass
species (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Smith2000}{Smith et al. 2000};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Nagel2004}{Nagel et al. 2004}), strengthening the
fuel connectivity to burn severity to seed composition feedback loop.
All four of these external drivers are globally ubiquitous consequences
of global change.

The ``state'' the ecosystem is the product of countless endogenous
interactions. The grass-fire cycle studied here is reinforced through
providing fitness benefits to the introduced annual grasses via at least
three redundant processes: i) changing the composition of the seedbank,
ii) competitive exclusion of native plants, iii) ecohydrological
feedbacks that create a warmer, drier microclimate
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Turnbull2012}{Turnbull et al. 2012};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wilcox2012}{Wilcox et al. 2012}). It is likely
that some of these feedbacks are idiosyncratic to the system being
studied, while others may reflect fundamental properties of ecosystem
function that change when a system is converted from being dominated by
woody plants to being dominated by herbaceous plants
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kitzberger2016}{Kitzberger et al. 2016}). At
least 13 grass species initiate self-reinforcing feedbacks with fire in
the U.S. alone (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Fusco2019}{Fusco et al. 2019};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tortorelli2020}{Tortorelli, Krawchuk, and Kerns
2020}). There are likely many more worldwide, beyond documented cases in
Australia (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Miller2010}{G. Miller et al. 2010};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Setterfield2010}{Setterfield et al. 2010}),
Brazil (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rossi2014}{Rossi et al. 2014}) and South
Africa (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Milton2004}{Milton 2004}). The conversion
of temperate forests and shrublands to grasslands has consequences
relevant to the global carbon cycle, especially when forests (rather
than the shrublands studied here) are replaced by herbaceous ecosystems
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kerns2020}{Kerns et al. 2020}).

Interestingly enough, thinking back to classic conceptual models like
the saddle-node bifurcation curve, or the ball and cup visualization
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Scheffer2015}{Marten Scheffer et al. 2015}), the
multivariate nature of both the driver and response leads us to expand
both the driver and the response axes to n-dimensional space, and
perhaps a more accurate conceptual visualization of ecosystems
transformation due to multiple global change drivers more closely
resembles the loss landscapes generated by artificial neural networks
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Li2018}{Li et al. 2018}).

\textbf{\emph{Potential limitations}}

We found fewer species and lower diversity in our seedbank germination
assays than we did in the aboveground sampling (Appendix S1, Fig. S3).
This result may be influenced by the methodological limitations inherent
to greenhouse germination trials
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Vandvik2016}{Vandvik et al. 2016}). In
particular our results may be understating the occurrence of native
species that are habitat specialists. Habitat specialists have been
shown to emerge more in \emph{in situ} germination assays than in
greenhouse germination assays, while the opposite has been found for
ruderal species (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Plue2017}{Plue et al. 2017}).
Nevertheless, for those species that were prevalent in our germination
studies, we still found consistent relationships between their abundance
and occurrence by biogeographic origin, and those species that were most
prevalent in the seedbank germination assays were also representative of
those that we observed in the aboveground community.

\textbf{\emph{Contrasts among forests and shrublands as it pertains to
remote sensing}}

Burn severity metrics like dNBR were conceived of in the context of
forested ecosystems, and calibrated using the composite burn index
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Key1999}{Key and Benson 1999}), tree mortality,
and percent change in tree canopy cover
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Miller2009}{J. D. Miller et al. 2009}). It is
unclear how well these metrics carry over to shrubland systems. We
recorded qualitative observations of burn severity while we were
sampling, mainly to ensure that we sampled a range of severities, and
the dNBR we used appears to correspond with our observations. In areas
where the space between shrubs was well-connected by fine fuels (Figure
2 a-c) the dNBR was higher, and the shrubs had completely burned
throughout the root system, leaving only a hole in the ground filled
with ashes as evidence of their prior presence. In these areas the
entirety of the soil surface---underneath shrub canopy and in canopy
interspaces---was consumed by fire, and there was little evidence of
remaining litter or biological soil crust. Areas with lower fuel
connectivity had lower dNBR (Figure 2 d-f). Here, shrubs were usually
consumed only to the stumps, and sometimes left standing and charred,
destined for mortality. In these areas the soil surface often still had
biological soil crust, partially consumed litter
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jones2015}{R. O. Jones et al. 2015}) and
unconsumed annual and perennial grass bases. The manual severity
classification provided by MTBS had exclusively low and medium severity,
but our observations of essentially complete consumption of plant and
litter tissues and very few unburned patches suggested that these should
have been mostly medium and high severity. This discrepancy was not
unexpected, as the ordinal burn severity classifications produced by
MTBS are known to be of limited use for research
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kolden2015}{Kolden, Smith, and Abatzoglou
2015}).

Spectral reflectance has long been used to characterize ecosystem
structure, including wildfire fuels. Unique signatures of
remotely-sensed spectral reflectance are typically matched to
categorical fuel classifications (CFCs), which describe the physiognomy
of vegetation and its potential to support various fire behavior
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ottmar2007}{Ottmar et al. 2007}). While
different CFCs can provide a general understanding of fuel amount and
connectivity, recent efforts using data with finer spatial and spectral
resolution may improve fuel classification with more continuous,
multi-dimensional measurements
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Stavros2018}{Stavros et al. 2018}). The
continuous measure of NDVI in western U.S. coniferous forests is a proxy
for live fuel biomass, which likely explains its positive association
with wildfire severity (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Parks2018}{Sean A. Parks
et al. 2018}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-Koontz2020}{Koontz et al. 2020}).
NDVI also correlates with vegetation cover in these forested systems,
and so greater crown connectivity may also explain the NDVI/severity
relationship at local scales. When using a more direct NDVI-derived
measure of vegetation connectivity in Sierra Nevada yellow
pine/mixed-conifer, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Koontz2020}{Koontz et al.}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Koontz2020}{2020}) found that greater
variability in forest structure also increased the probability of
high-severity fire. Here, we arrived at a combination of NDVI and NDSVI
to describe the fuel connectivity of the annual grass invaded Great
Basin sagebrush community to better reflect key differences in the
physiognomies of forest and arid shrublands. In sagebrush shrublands,
the fuel that contributes to large wildfires is a mixture of evergreen
shrubs interspersed with herbaceous plants that remain green for only a
portion of the growing season, and then become dry and straw-colored.
Thus, both the live and dead fuel need to be taken into account in
remote measurements of fuel connectivity.

\textbf{\emph{Management implications}}

These results demonstrate that the strength of the grass-fire cycle in
this system is controlled by measurable fire properties and ecosystem
structural components. Land managers may be able to increase their
chances of restoration success by using existing methods or developing
novel ones that manipulate these components to weaken or even break the
positive feedback cycle. This work provides further evidence that the
post-fire annual grassland is a system where the degraded state
represents an alternative species assemblage from that of the
restoration target. Because the propagules of the original assemblage
are no longer present, methods that rely on natural succession may not
be sufficient (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Suding2004}{Suding, Gross, and
Houseman 2004}). Estimating burn severity using satellite imagery may
help land managers identify areas with a greater likelihood of
successful seeding. Our results highlight the importance of prioritizing
the preservation of existing native shrub cover and in particular
policies that encourage land managers to maximize the preservation of
unburned patches within the fire perimeter during the suppression of
wildfires in this system
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Steenvoorden2019}{Steenvoorden et al. 2019}), as
these are the primary sources of native propagules.

Livestock grazing can reduce fuel connectivity in uninvaded sagebrush
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Davies2010}{Davies et al. 2010}). At the same
time, livestock grazing can decrease the resistance to invasion by
\emph{B. tectorum} via negative effects on biological soil crust (BSC)
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-chambers_resilience_2014}{Chambers et al. 2014};
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Condon2018}{Condon and Pyke 2018}), and can
reduce the survival of \emph{Artemisia} seedlings that are not protected
by shrub canopies (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Owens1992}{Owens and Norton
1992}). In wet years, targeted grazing at already invaded sites may
reduce fuel connectivity and alleviate fire risk. Post-fire grazing may
help reduce \emph{B. tectorum} cover, but it may also exacerbate the
problem by introducing cheatgrass in uninvaded sites
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Williamson2019}{Williamson et al. 2019}) or
increasing the already superior postfire dispersal of \emph{B. tectorum}
seeds (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Monty2013}{Monty, Brown, and Johnston
2013}). We suggest management approaches that are specifically tailored
each year to the conditions of a given site, and targeting grazing only
in already invaded areas to reduce \emph{B. tectorum} cover where it may
aid in native plant restoration.

Herbaceous cover in these dryland systems has high interannual
variability (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mahood2021}{Mahood et al. 2022}).
Because the components of ecosystem structure and disturbance severity
in positive feedback cycle described here are continuous mechanistic
variables, it may be possible to develop theoretical models
(\emph{sensu} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Ludwig1978}{Ludwig, Jones, and
Holling 1978})) to model the threshold of vegetation cover that will
lead to high burn severity. These can then be applied in conjunction
with near real time fuel loading forecasts
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jones2021}{M. O. Jones et al. 2021}) to identify
areas that are vulnerable to high severity fire, which can be used by
land managers to take preemptive measures in high value areas.

\textbf{Figure 1.} On the left side of (a), burn severity (dNBR) as
predicted by total vegetation cover (TVC; the sum of live and dead,
shrub and herbaceous cover). On the right, burn severity is predicted by
modelled TVC. Panel b shows the modelled occurrence of germinable seeds
for all species found at more than one location along a gradient of burn
severity, after accounting for soil depth, aspect, elevation and
pre-fire diversity. Black line is the mean prediction, each colored line
represents one posterior sample. In (c), fuel connectivity three years
post-fire is modelled by seedbank composition, elevation and pre-fire
aboveground species richness. In (d) shannon-Weaver diversity index of
the aboveground, post-fire community composition, was negatively
affected by fuel connectivity after accounting for elevation. For a, c
and d, lines are the fitted partial effects, points are the partial
residuals, and dotted lines are the 95\% confidence intervals. p
\textless{} 0.05 for black lines, p \textgreater{} 0.05 for grey lines.

\textbf{Figure 2.} Visual illustration of the relationship between fuel
connectivity and burn severity. On the left, panel a shows the
intershrub space invaded by annual grasses. The photo in panel b was
taken in the exact same place two weeks later, days after all of the
biomass was consumed by the fire. Panel C is a closeup of the soil
surface, showing in more detail how the litter was also almost
completely consumed by the fire. On the right, the photos in panels d
and e were on opposite sides of a fire line in an area that had minimal
annual grass invasion over a broad area, and thus lower fuel
connectivity. Note the remaining plants and stumps in panel e and the
presence of only partially consumed litter in panel f.
